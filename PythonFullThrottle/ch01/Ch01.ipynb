    "| **_Scientific Computing and Statistics_** |\n",
    "| **NumPy** (Numerical Python)—Python does not have a built-in array data structure. It uses lists, which are convenient but relatively slow. NumPy provides the high-performance `ndarray` data structure to represent lists and matrices, and it also provides routines for processing such data structures.  |\n",
    "| **SciPy** (Scientific Python)—Built on NumPy, SciPy adds routines for scientific processing, such as integrals, differential equations, additional matrix processing and more. `scipy.org` controls SciPy and NumPy.  |\n",

    "| **Data Manipulation and Analysis** |\n",

    "| |\n",
    "| **_Visualization_** |\n",
    "| **Matplotlib**—A highly customizable visualization and plotting library. Supported plots include regular, scatter, bar, contour, pie, quiver, grid, polar axis, 3D and text. |\n",
    "| **Seaborn**—A higher-level visualization library built on Matplotlib. Seaborn adds a nicer look-and-feel, additional visualizations and enables you to create visualizations with less code.    |\n",

    "| **Keras**—One of the easiest to use deep-learning libraries. Keras runs on top of TensorFlow (Google). |\n",
    "| **TensorFlow**—From Google, this is the most widely used deep learning library. TensorFlow works with GPUs (graphics processing units) or Google’s custom TPUs (Tensor processing units) for performance. TensorFlow is important in AI and big data analytics—where processing demands are huge. You’ll use the version of Keras that’s built into TensorFlow. |\n",

    "| **Gensim**—Similar to NLTK. Commonly used to build an index for a collection of documents, then determine how similar another document is to each of those in the index.  |"
