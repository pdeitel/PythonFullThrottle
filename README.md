# Setup for Executing the Examples
If you intend to execute code in parallel with me during the live training (which you don't need to do, but can), you'll want to do one of the following:

1. For a **zero-install environment**, you can go to the following mybinder.org link, which will allocate a cloud-based environment and load this repository's Jupyter Notebooks https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pdeitel/PythonFullThrottle/master?urlpath=lab.
2. You can run everything locally on your computer. To do so, install the Anaconda Python Distribution for Python 3.9 at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
3. You can use one of the Jupyter team's preconfigured Docker containrs:
> `docker run -p 8888:8888 -it --user root -v fullPathTo/PythonFullThrottle:/home/jovyan/work jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest start.sh jupyter lab`

In #3, **be sure to replace `fullPathTo/PythonFullThrottle` with the actual location where you download my code on your system**.

# Our Books on Which These Examples Are Based
The content of this course is based on our book <a href=https://amzn.to/2Kd8dQk target="_blank">Python for Programmers</a>, which is a subset of our book <a href=https://amzn.to/2KfCptN target="_blank">Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science: Learning to Program with AI, Big Data and the Cloud.</a> Both are available to O'Reilly Online Learning subscribers.
